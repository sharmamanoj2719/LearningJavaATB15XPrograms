/*Typecasting means converting one data type into another in Java.
It is mainly used with primitive data types.
Widening typecasting converts small data to big data automatically (int → double).
Narrowing typecasting converts big data to small data manually using (datatype).
Narrowing may cause data loss, widening is safe.*/
